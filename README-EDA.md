# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

This repository contains the materials and outputs related to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a given dataset. The goal of this EDA is to understand the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and formulate initial hypotheses.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- **`data/`**: This directory is intended to store the **processed or cleaned datasets** that are used for the EDA. Any data transformations or cleaning steps performed will result in files stored here.
- **`folium_maps/`**: This directory will contain any **interactive maps** generated using the `folium` library during the EDA process. These maps might visualize geographical data or spatial patterns within the dataset.
- **`Scripts/`**: This directory houses the **Python script** containing the Python code used for conducting the EDA. Each notebook will likely focus on specific aspects of the analysis or different stages of the exploration.
- **`Raw_data/`**: This directory is meant to store the **original, unprocessed datasets**. Keeping the raw data separate ensures that the original information is preserved and any modifications are tracked.
- **`ydata_profile_reports_on_data/`**: This directory will contain **data profile reports** generated using libraries like `ydata-profiling`. These reports provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including statistics, visualizations, and potential issues.
- **`EDA_documentation.pdf`**: This file contains a **PDF document** providing a more detailed explanation of the EDA process, findings, and insights. It might include summaries, interpretations, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
- **`README.md`**: This file (the one you are currently reading) provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Contents and Usage

- **Data Exploration:** The Jupyter Notebooks in the `Notebooks/` directory contain the step-by-step process of exploring the data. You can open these notebooks to understand the code, visualizations, and analysis performed.
- **Data Preparation:** Any data cleaning or preprocessing steps are likely documented and implemented within the notebooks, with the resulting cleaned data stored in the `data/` directory.
- **Visualizations:** The EDA process will involve creating various visualizations to understand data distributions, relationships between variables, and potential outliers. These visualizations might be embedded in the notebooks or saved as separate files (e.g., within the respective directories).
- **Interactive Maps:** If the dataset contains geographical information, the `folium_maps/` directory will contain interactive maps that allow for exploration of spatial patterns.
- **Data Profiling:** The `ydata_profile_reports_on_data/` directory provides automated, detailed reports on the characteristics of the datasets used. These reports can be a quick way to get a comprehensive understanding of the data.
- **Documentation:** The `EDA_documentation.pdf` file offers a more structured and potentially higher-level overview of the entire EDA process, its goals, methodologies, and key findings.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmdenaAI/Repzone.git
   cd Repzone

2. **Explore the directories:** Navigate through the different directories to understand the organization of the project.

3. **View the EDA notebooks:** Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the Notebooks/ directory to follow the analysis steps and understand the code. You might need to install the necessary Python libraries (see the "Dependencies" section below).

4. **Examine the data:** The data/ and Raw_data/ directories contain the processed and original datasets, respectively.

5. **Inspect the reports:** Open the PDF documentation (EDA_documentation.pdf) for a summary of the findings. Review the HTML reports in ydata_profile_reports_on_data/ for detailed data profiles.

6. **Interact with maps:** Open the HTML files in the folium_maps/ directory to explore the interactive geographical visualizations.


## Dependencies
